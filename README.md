# Python 🐍, Data Analysis 🔬 ....

## Online Resources for Continuing Python/Data Analysis Familiarity


* Codefinity is a useful platform for quick reminders and in-browser coding exercises to accompany lessons

* Sharpsight is a more academy and resource defined platform that has video/pdf type outlays and then has separate coding exercises/walkthrough for shared topics

## **50 Days of Python - Challenges, Python Exercise Notebooks & Scripts**
### `50 Days of Python`
* Challenges can be painful ... but are the essential building blocks to develop familiarity and gain confidence in any walk of life :walking:
* `Benjamin Alexander's` 50 Days of Python was a rewarding and useful resource for re-familiarizing myself with the language and creating solutions for the provided challenges to be solved with Python
* Below is a referential link to my solutions for the different challenges along with context to the topics covered for when I undoubtedly would like to remember how I do "X" with Python
    - Programming is (as I say) just a constant loop of re-learning similar concepts ... sorry I don't do very well on stand-up either 🎤
