## Python Projects
As Python is king in the data world, it's critical to get first hand experience using it's robust libraries and architecture. Below is a handful of projects/tasks completed showcasing such.

### PIL Image Library / Contact Sheet
* This quick project was part of the final capstone project for the Python Specialization Coursera offers in tandem with the University of Michigan
* Within the Jupyter Notebook, the progression and task completion can be reviewed for building a contact sheet with a provided image
* The tasks use modules of the `PIL` Imaging Library to complete tasks such as 
    * Concatenating and dynamically adding multilple PIL image instances to a parent contact sheet
    * Drawing and Writing text to the modified images for the various channels
    * Channel setting and usage of PIL instance properties like .point to modify per assingment rubric

### PyTesseract (Image & Text Recognition)
* Final project for the Specialization credential challenged us to use various libraries [PIL, Pytesseract, cv (detection classifier)] to extract faces from a zipped file of text files (newspapers)
* Tasks included 
    * Iterating through zipped file and subsequent classification with pytesseract (ocr)
    * MultiScale face detection and gray scale conversion with stated libraries above
    * Facial recognition (bounding boxes) extraction for "facial" image recognition 
    * Contact Sheet Creation 
* - Link to project site once uploaded
