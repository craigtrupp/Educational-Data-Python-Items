## **Python3 Programming Specialization Review** üë®‚Äçüíª
This specialization teaches the fundamentals of programming in Python 3. We will begin at the beginning, with variables, conditionals, and loops, and get to some intermediate material like keyword parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class inheritance.

You will have lots of opportunities to practice. You will also learn ways to reason about program execution, so that it is no longer mysterious and you are able to debug programs when they don‚Äôt work.

By the end of the specialization, you‚Äôll be writing programs that query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information from them.  And you‚Äôll be able to learn to use new modules and APIs on your own by reading the documentation. That will give you a great launch toward being an independent Python programmer.

Below is a referential link to captured items throughout the program for github.

### `Sections` üìÅ
As a note, the sections detail items I captured and don't follow to a T the layout of the course material as various sections served as a review, let's get into it!

#### **Test Exercises** üöµ
* [API Requests & Provided Caching Library](/Coursera/Specializations/Python3/TestExercises/API_Chpt3_Assmnt.py)
* [API Requests/JSON Exploratory](/Coursera/Specializations/Python3/TestExercises/API_initial.py)

* [Test Cases, Exceptions, Try/Except](/Coursera/Specializations/Python3/TestExercises/Test%20Cases%2C%20Exceptions%20%26%20Unit%20Assessment.ipynb)
    - Good referential file for exceptions, error handling and assertions

#### **Python Challenges/Projects** :classical_building:
* This section does contain items from other items outside of the UMich specialization as well
* `Short Projects`
    - Please visit this repository for more detail on projects within this folder
    - Most notable from this specialization was the challenging final modules to receive the specialization on using pillow, tesseract, and open cv as a cumulative test for students looking to combine items into a working script
